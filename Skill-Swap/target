Absolutely! Here's a **medium-level hackathon-style project** that you can build in **4 days** using the **MERN stack**:

## 🚀 Project Idea: **SkillSwap – Peer-to-Peer Learning Platform**

### 🔥 Concept:
A platform where users can **offer to teach** a skill they know and **request to learn** skills from others. Think of it as "You teach me graphic design, I'll teach you JavaScript."
## 🛠️ Tech Stack: **MERN**

- **MongoDB** – Store users, skills, offers, and requests  
- **Express.js** – Backend API  
- **React.js** – Frontend UI  
- **Node.js** – Server-side JavaScript

## 📅 Suggested 4-Day Plan

### ✅ Day 1: Setup & Authentication
- Project structure (frontend + backend)
- MongoDB connection
- User authentication (JWT)
- Registration/Login pages (React)

### ✅ Day 2: Core Features – Skill Offer & Request
- Dashboard to post:
  - "I can teach" (skill offer)
  - "I want to learn" (skill request)
- List of available skill matches
- Backend APIs to manage offers & requests

### ✅ Day 3: Matching System
- Match people based on skill tags
- Allow users to connect (maybe via chat or simple contact)
- Create a simple matching algorithm:
  - If person A wants to learn "React" and person B offers "React" → match

### ✅ Day 4: Polish & Deploy
- Add user profiles
- Add styling (Tailwind, Bootstrap, or custom CSS)
- Deploy on **Render/Heroku** (Backend) and **Vercel/Netlify** (Frontend)
- Polish UI & add README

## ✨ Bonus Features (if time allows)
- Live chat using socket.io
- Notifications when a match is found
- Rating system after a learning session
- Scheduling sessions via calendar

## 🔗 MongoDB Collections (Schema Idea)
- **Users**: name, email, password, bio, skillsOffered, skillsWanted
- **SkillOffers**: userId, skill, description, availability
- **SkillRequests**: userId, skill, goal, urgency
- **Matches**: userA, userB, skill, status
